//AIM: Write a program to display result of student according to their marks using Switch case

//CODE:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class marks
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		 Scanner readme = new Scanner(System.in);	//created scanner class object
		 System.out.println("Enter Number " );
		int n1;	//one variable for storing marks
		n1 = readme.nextInt();	//scanned from user
		System.out.println("\nYour Result is:\n");
		switch(n1/10)	//switch case for generating greades
		{
			
			case 10:
			case 9:
			case 8:
				   System.out.println("Congratulations You have passed with A+");
				   break;
			case 7:
			case 6:
				   System.out.println("Very good You have passed with A");
				   break;
			case 5:
				   System.out.println("Good You have passed with B+");
				   break;
			case 4:
				   System.out.println("You passed with C+");
